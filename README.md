# Soft-Serial

Sorry, Microsoft's purchase of Github doesn't include my code.

Unless of course some of that $7.5B is coming this way. I guess
it's a good thing that a couple of folks are getting rich because
of the open source efforts of others. Now Microsoft owns all that 
code. 

Between M and Z, are the people actually writing code making any money?
